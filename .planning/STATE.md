## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
All v1.5 decisions archived — see milestones/v1.5-ROADMAP.md for full list.

### Pending Todos

- [ ] Announce v1.2 Community Collections launch (320 total questions live)
- [ ] Invite volunteers to GitHub org
- [ ] Share live URLs with team
- [ ] Update Phase 19 audit script to populate violation_count column when saving quality scores

### Known Tech Debt

- violation_count column may go stale if quality rules change without re-audit
- ILIKE search may degrade beyond 1000 questions (consider pg_trgm GIN index)
- useBlocker unavailable (requires createBrowserRouter) — sidebar nav during edit won't prompt for unsaved changes

### Blockers/Concerns

None. v1.6 roadmap complete. Ready to plan Phase 31.
