## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 78 (26 v1.0 + 11 v1.1 + 15 v1.2 + 17 v1.3 + 6 v1.4 + 3 v1.5)
- Quick tasks completed: 9

- Total execution time: ~10 days (2026-02-13 → 2026-02-22)

**By Milestone:**

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Duration |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| v1.0 MVP | 1-7 | 26 | 2026-02-13 |
| v1.1 Production Hardening | 8-12 | 11 | 2026-02-18 |
| v1.2 Community Collections | 13-17 | 15 | 2026-02-19 |
| v1.3 Quality & Admin | 18-22 | 17 | 2026-02-20 |
| v1.4 Fremont CA | 23-26 | 6 | 2026-02-21 |
| v1.5 Feedback Marks | 27-30 | 3 | In progress |

**Recent Trend:**
- Consistent daily milestone delivery
- v1.4 completed in 2 days (smallest scope)
- Strong execution velocity

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v1.5 work:

- Phase 21: Quality guidelines in all locale system prompts — embed quality rules in generation to reduce validation retries
- Phase 24: Overshoot-and-curate generation strategy — generate 130%, curate to target for quality buffer
- Phase 26: Accept 92 questions (below 95 target) — quality over quantity principle
- Phase 27-01: Rate limiter only on POST /flag, not DELETE — allow unrestricted unflagging (corrective action, not abuse vector)
- Phase 27-01: Fail-open rate limiting on Redis errors — availability over abuse prevention when Redis unavailable
- Phase 27-01: Denormalize flag_count on questions table — avoid COUNT(*) queries for performance
- Phase 27-02: Independent tooltip implementation for FlagButton — CSS hover tooltip instead of LearnMoreTooltip system (avoid tooltip system complexity)
- Phase 27-02: Optimistic UI updates for flag state — immediate local state change with API rollback on failure for responsive game feel
- Phase 28-01: No rate limiter on batch elaboration endpoint — infrequent post-game action not abuse vector
- Phase 28-01: Null for empty elaborations — database normalization (easier to query "has elaboration")
- Phase 28-01: Equal visual weight for Skip/Submit buttons — no dark patterns, respect user choice equally

### Pending Todos

- [ ] Announce v1.2 Community Collections launch (320 total questions live)
- [ ] Invite volunteers to GitHub org
- [ ] Share live URLs with team
- [ ] Update Phase 19 audit script to populate violation_count column when saving quality scores

### Known Tech Debt

- All 320 original questions have broken source.url Learn More links (legacy CMS migration) — DEBT-01 addresses in Phase 30
- violation_count column may go stale if quality rules change without re-audit
- ILIKE search may degrade beyond 1000 questions (consider pg_trgm GIN index)
- useBlocker unavailable (requires createBrowserRouter) — sidebar nav during edit won't prompt for unsaved changes
- seed-questions.ts comment says status='draft' but scripts insert as 'active'

### Blockers/Concerns

None. v1.5 leverages existing patterns:
- Auth system (JWT) supports authenticated-only flagging
- Game session management (Redis) ready for feedbackFlags field
- Admin UI (React + TanStack Table) supports new review queue
- Database (PostgreSQL + Drizzle) ready for question_flags table

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-22
Topic: Phase 28 Progressive Disclosure UI execution
Stopped at: Completed 28-01-PLAN.md - batch elaboration endpoint with ReasonChip, FlaggedQuestionItem, and FeedbackElaborationScreen components
Resume file: None — ready for 28-02-PLAN.md (Game Flow Integration)

Next action: Execute 28-02-PLAN.md to wire elaboration screen into post-game flow
