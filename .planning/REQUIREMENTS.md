### Curator Rewards

- **RWRD-02**: System tracks feedback quality score per user (good flags vs spam)
- **RWRD-03**: Volume reduction for accounts that spam flags (lower weight in flag counts)

### Advanced Moderation

- **MODR-01**: Admin can mark feedback as helpful/unhelpful to train quality signals
- **MODR-02**: Flagged question auto-deactivation threshold (e.g., 5+ flags from trusted curators)
- **MODR-03**: Feedback loop — notify player when their flag led to question improvement

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Public flag counts visible to players | Negative social proof, hurts encouraging tone |
| Flag during question (before answer) | Player hasn't seen the full question context yet |
| Anonymous flagging | Cannot track quality, enables spam, no accountability |
| "Report problem" / bug report workflow | This is quality curation, not bug reporting |
| Real-time admin notifications for new flags | Batch review sufficient at current scale |
| Flag categories for admin (duplicate, offensive) | Simple archive workflow sufficient for v1.5 |
