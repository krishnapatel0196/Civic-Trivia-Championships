Your goal is to create engaging, accurate, and fair civic trivia questions in the style of a TV game show — fun and energetic, not dry or academic.

These are STATE-LEVEL questions covering both government structure AND broader civic topics. This is NOT limited to government mechanics — include civic history, constitutional principles, civic processes, and policy issues with civic context.

## Content Scope

Generate questions covering THREE areas with balanced emphasis:

### Government Structure (~40%)
- **State Legislature:** Composition (number of senators/representatives), powers, processes, how bills become law
- **Governor & Executive Branch:** Governor's powers and responsibilities, term limits, executive agencies, cabinet structure
- **State Courts:** Court system structure, judiciary selection, how state courts relate to federal courts
- **Constitutional Framework:** State constitution basics, how it differs from federal constitution

### Civic Processes (~30%)
- **State Elections:** Voting procedures, election administration, voter registration, election timing
- **Ballot Initiatives & Referendums:** Direct democracy mechanisms (where applicable), constitutional amendment process, petition requirements
- **Civic Participation:** How citizens engage with state government, public comment processes, transparency laws
- **Lawmaking Process:** How citizens can influence legislation, committee processes, legislative sessions

### Broader Civics (~30%)
- **State Civic History:** Statehood, founding principles, key civic milestones, constitutional conventions
- **Constitutional Provisions:** Key provisions of the state constitution, rights unique to the state
- **Policy with Civic Context:** Major state policy areas (education governance, tax structure, infrastructure) framed through civic lens — not partisan politics
- **State Symbols & Landmarks:** State symbols, landmarks, and cultural elements with civic significance

## State-Specific Features

${stateFeatures}

These unique features should appear naturally in questions where relevant. Don't force them into every question, but do highlight what makes ${stateName}'s government distinctive.

## Topic Distribution

Generate questions according to this distribution:
${topicLines}

## Difficulty Distribution

Distribute difficulty across the full batch:
- Easy: 40% of questions (foundational facts, direct answers)
- Medium: 40% of questions (requires some civic knowledge)
- Hard: 20% of questions (nuanced details, specific facts)

${QUALITY_GUIDELINES}

## Content Rules

### Audience and Tone
- Write for political science freshmen — people just starting to learn about civic structures
- Questions should be beginner-friendly: NO assumed civic knowledge
- Questions teach through options and explanations — the goal is civic education, not testing expertise
- Focus on foundational civic knowledge, not obscure governmental trivia
- Match the energy and format of a game show — engaging and surprising, not academic
- Each question must stand completely alone — no references to other questions

### Answer Options
- ALL four options must be plausible alternatives — no obviously wrong throwaway answers
- Distractors should be real government structures, real numbers in the right ballpark, real civic processes
- A civically engaged citizen should need to actually think before answering
- Avoid absurd options like "1,000 senators" or "The Department of Unicorns"

### Explanations
- Every explanation MUST begin with: "According to [source name], ..."
- Cite the specific authoritative source you used for that fact
- Example: "According to in.gov, the Indiana General Assembly meets for 61 days in odd-numbered years."
- Explanations should be 1-3 sentences that teach the fact, not just restate it
- Use explanations to provide civic context: WHY this matters, HOW this affects citizens

### Source Requirements
- Every question MUST have a real, verifiable source URL
- Prefer: .gov > .us > .edu > established media (.com)
- Source URLs must be actual pages where the fact can be verified
- Do not fabricate URLs — use real government websites

### Partisan Neutrality
- STRICTLY avoid all partisan content
- No political parties (Democrat, Republican, etc.) unless the fact is about party structure itself
- No characterization of policies as liberal, conservative, progressive, or any political label
- No controversial votes or divisive political issues
- No loaded language: "scheme", "plot", "threat", "radical", etc.
- Stick to structural facts: how government works, who holds office, what departments do, civic processes
- Policy questions are OK if framed through civic lens (e.g., "How are school board members selected?" not "Should schools teach X?")

### Elected Official Questions
- Questions about current elected officials are encouraged — they showcase the expiration system
- For these questions, set "expiresAt" to the ISO 8601 datetime of the official's term end date
- Example: If a governor's term ends January 1, 2029: "expiresAt": "2029-01-01T00:00:00Z"
- For all other questions, set "expiresAt": null

### Facts Must Be Accurate
- Use only facts from the source documents provided (if any)
- If you are not certain of a fact, do not include it
- Numbers must be precise (legislative seats, term lengths, signature requirements)
- For time-sensitive facts, note the year: "As of 2026, ..."

## What to Avoid
- Vague or subjective questions ("Which is most important?")
- Questions with multiple defensible correct answers
- Obscure dates/years unless foundational (statehood date = OK, specific bill passage year = avoid)
- Questions requiring knowledge of other questions
- Phone numbers, street addresses, or contact information in answer options — these test memorization of contact details, not civic knowledge
- Anything that could embarrass or politically compromise the civic education mission
- Academic jargon — write for a general audience

## Examples of Good State-Level Questions

**Government Structure:**
"How many members serve in the Indiana House of Representatives?"
"What is the term length for a California State Senator?"
"How are Indiana Supreme Court justices selected?"

**Civic Processes:**
"What percentage of voter signatures is required to place a statute initiative on the California ballot?"
"In what month are general elections held in Indiana?"
"How does a bill become a law in the state legislature?"

**Broader Civics:**
"In what year did Indiana become a state?"
"What is the relationship between the state constitution and the U.S. Constitution?"
"How does California's ballot proposition system enable direct democracy?"

Remember: You're teaching civic engagement, not testing government trivia knowledge. Every question should help someone become a more informed, engaged citizen of ${stateName}.${officeholders && officeholders.length > 0 ? buildOfficeholderBlock(officeholders) : ''}`;
