/**
 * Texas state configuration for civic trivia question generation.
 * Used by generate-locale-questions.ts to produce the Texas State collection.
 *
 * CRITICAL ACCURACY NOTES:
 * - The legislature meets biennially (odd-numbered years only), 140-day constitutional limit
 * - Lt. Governor is President of the Senate with outsized power (sets agenda, appoints committees)
 * - Texas has TWO courts of last resort: Supreme Court (civil) and Court of Criminal Appeals (criminal)
 * - Railroad Commission regulates oil/gas, NOT railroads (since 2005)
 * - Plural executive: Governor, Lt. Gov, AG, Comptroller, Land Commissioner, Ag Commissioner, RRC all elected separately
 * - 1876 Constitution is still in effect -- longest in US (80,000+ words, hundreds of amendments)
 * - State-only: no questions about specific Texas cities (Austin state institutions are OK)
 * - MIXED DURABILITY: generate both expiring (current-officeholder) and durable questions

export const texasStateFeatures = `
Texas has several unique features in its state government that MUST be accurately represented:

**MIXED DURABILITY INSTRUCTION (NEW PATTERN)**
Generate a mix of durable civic facts and expiring current-officeholder questions. This is intentional -- both types add civic value.
- For current officeholders and time-sensitive facts, set expiresAt to the end of their current term
- All statewide elected officials face election in November 2026; terms expire approximately January 19, 2027
- Set expiresAt: "2027-01-19T00:00:00Z" for all current-officeholder questions
- For durable structural/historical facts, set expiresAt: null
- No fixed ratio required -- generate as many of each as make good trivia
- "Who is the Lt. Governor of Texas?" is an example of a compelling expiring question we WANT

**CRITICAL: STATE-ONLY RULE**
- ALL questions must be about Texas statewide institutions, laws, events, or history
- Do NOT reference specific Texas cities in any question
- Austin STATE institutions are acceptable (the Capitol, Governor's Mansion, state agencies housed in Austin)
- Austin CITY facts are NOT acceptable (Austin city council, Austin mayor, Austin local services)
- Other cities explicitly excluded: Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Fort Worth, El Paso, Plano, Arlington -- no city government, city history, or city-specific facts
- If a fact is about a city that happens to be in Texas, it does NOT belong in this collection

**TEXAS LEGISLATURE**
- Bicameral: 31 Senate members (4-year terms) and 150 House of Representatives members (2-year terms)
- Biennial regular sessions: meets only in ODD-numbered years, 140-day constitutional limit
- The 89th Legislature convened January 14, 2025 and must adjourn by June 2, 2025
- The 90th Legislature will not convene until January 2027
- NEVER say "annual sessions" -- Texas has biennial regular sessions
- Governor may call special sessions (30-day limit per session, no limit on number of sessions)
- Speaker of the House: Dade Phelan (as of 89th Legislature)

**LT. GOVERNOR'S OUTSIZED POWER**
- The Lt. Governor serves as President of the Texas Senate
- Sets the Senate agenda, appoints all Senate committee chairs and members
- Chairs the Legislative Budget Board (controls state budget process)
- Arguably more powerful than the Governor in legislative matters -- this is a distinctive Texas civic fact
- Lt. Governor: Dan Patrick (R) -- term expires January 2027 -> expiresAt: "2027-01-19T00:00:00Z"

**PLURAL EXECUTIVE**
- Texas has a plural executive: Governor, Lt. Governor, Attorney General, Comptroller, Land Commissioner, Agriculture Commissioner, Railroad Commissioners are ALL elected separately
- They do NOT report to the Governor and may be from different parties
- Secretary of State is the ONLY statewide officer appointed (not elected) -- appointed by the Governor
- Governor: Greg Abbott (R) -- third term, entered office January 2015 -> expiresAt: "2027-01-19T00:00:00Z"
- Attorney General: Ken Paxton (R) -- third term -> expiresAt: "2027-01-19T00:00:00Z" (running for US Senate, not AG re-election)
- Comptroller: CAUTION -- Glenn Hegar resigned February 2025; Kelly Hancock is acting Comptroller. Focus Comptroller questions on the ROLE and POWERS of the office, not the current officeholder. If generating a "Who is the Comptroller?" question, flag it for manual review.
- Secretary of State: Jane Nelson (R) -- appointed by Abbott; the only statewide officer NOT elected -> expiresAt: "2027-01-19T00:00:00Z"

**RAILROAD COMMISSION**
- Founded in 1891 to regulate railroads
- Now regulates oil, gas, and pipeline safety -- has NOT regulated railroads since 2005 (federal preemption)
- Three elected commissioners (6-year staggered terms)
- Despite its name, it is one of the most powerful energy regulators in the US
- The name/function mismatch is excellent trivia material

**TWO COURTS OF LAST RESORT**
- Texas Supreme Court: highest court for CIVIL and JUVENILE cases (9 justices)
- Court of Criminal Appeals: highest court for CRIMINAL cases including death penalty (9 judges)
- Only Texas and Oklahoma have this dual-court structure -- genuinely distinctive
- All Texas judges are elected in PARTISAN elections

**1876 CONSTITUTION**
- Current Texas Constitution, ratified February 15, 1876
- Drafted as a reaction to the Reconstruction-era 1869 Constitution (seen as too centralized)
- Longest state constitution in the US: 80,000+ words, 17 articles
- Hundreds of amendments (over 500 proposed, most approved by voters)
- Amendment process: two-thirds vote in each chamber of the legislature, then voter approval at election
- The length and amendment frequency are distinctive -- it is essentially a policy document, not just a framework

**TEXAS HISTORY AND IDENTITY**
- Republic of Texas: 1836-1845 (9 years as an independent nation)
- Sam Houston: President of the Republic of Texas twice (1836-38, 1841-44); first Governor of the State of Texas; removed as Governor in 1861 for refusing to take the Confederate oath -- excellent civic story
- Annexation: Texas joined the US in 1845 by joint resolution of Congress
- Juneteenth: June 19, 1865 -- Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston and announced emancipation, more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Juneteenth originated as a Texas celebration before becoming a federal holiday in 2021.
- Secession (1861) and readmission (1870) -- frame as civic history, not political argument

**CIVIC LANDMARKS**
- Texas State Capitol: completed 1888, 302.64 feet tall -- intentionally built 14.64 feet taller than the US Capitol (288 ft). This is a signature civic trivia fact.
- Governor's Mansion: built 1856, oldest continuously occupied governor's residence west of the Mississippi
- The Alamo: San Antonio landmark, symbol of Texas independence (Battle of the Alamo, 1836) -- acceptable as state-level civic symbol, NOT as San Antonio city trivia

**PUBLIC POLICY HOOKS**
- ERCOT: Texas operates its own electric grid (the Texas Interconnection), managed by ERCOT, largely separate from the two main US grids. Deregulated retail electricity market since 2002.
- No state income tax: Texas relies on sales tax and property tax. The Comptroller certifies the state budget (revenue estimate).
- Water rights: dual system -- prior appropriation in western Texas, riparian rights in eastern Texas. Water is a major civic issue.
- General Land Office: manages state-owned lands including the Permanent School Fund (one of the largest educational endowments in the US)

**WHAT TO AVOID**
- Do NOT write questions about specific Texas city governments (Houston city council, Dallas mayor, etc.)
- Do NOT write questions about Texas sports teams, private companies, or universities as institutions
- Do NOT write questions about US Senators Ted Cruz or John Cornyn -- they are federal subjects, not state subjects
- Do NOT write questions whose answer is a phone number, street address, or budget figure
- Do NOT say "annual sessions" -- Texas has BIENNIAL sessions
- Apply the dinner party test: "Is this a surprising, shareable civic tidbit?" PASS: "What Texas agency was founded to regulate railroads but now regulates oil and gas?" FAIL: "What is the annual budget of the Texas Department of Transportation?"
