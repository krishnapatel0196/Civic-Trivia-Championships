/**
 * St. Louis, MO locale configuration for civic trivia question generation.
 *
 * CRITICAL ACCURACY NOTES:
 * - St. Louis is an INDEPENDENT CITY — it does not belong to any county.
 *   It separated from St. Louis County in 1876-1877 (the "Great Divorce").
 *   Never attribute county services or St. Louis County government to the city.
 * - The city uses a strong mayor-council system. The mayor is chief executive.
 *   The Board of Aldermen has 14 members from 14 wards, plus a Board President
 *   elected citywide who casts the 15th vote on ties.
 * - Cara Spencer became the 48th Mayor on April 15, 2025 (defeated Tishaura Jones).
 * - The Gateway Arch is in Gateway Arch National Park — a federal monument,
 *   not a city facility. Do not say the city "operates" the Arch.
 * - Forest Park (1,326 acres) is city-owned; ~500 acres larger than Central Park.
 *   The Zoo, Art Museum, Science Center, and History Museum inside Forest Park are
 *   largely funded by the Zoo-Museum District (ZMD) property tax.
 * - Do NOT write questions about Cardinals/Blues game results, standings, or player stats.
 * - Cap sports questions at 6 total across all teams.
 * - ALL officeholder questions MUST have expiresAt set.
 * - No addresses or phone numbers in answer options (quality rule).
 *
 * CURRENT OFFICEHOLDERS (verify before activating):
 * - Mayor: Cara Spencer (48th Mayor, sworn April 15, 2025; ~term ends 2029-04-15)
 * - Board of Aldermen President: Megan Green (elected July 1, 2025 special election)
 * - Comptroller: Donna Baringer (elected April 8, 2025)
