/**
 * Missouri state locale configuration for civic trivia question generation.
 *
 * CRITICAL ACCURACY NOTES:
 * - STATE-SCALE ONLY. Every question must be about statewide government, history,
 *   geography, or symbols. NO city-specific local government questions.
 * - Test: "Could a future city collection own this question?" If yes → cut it.
 * - St. Louis Gateway Arch is OK (statewide/national monument). St. Louis mayor is NOT OK.
 * - Kansas City is only OK for state-level context (e.g., "Missouri's largest city").
 * - Jefferson City questions (capital, legislature, capitol building) = OK.
 * - Mark Twain (stateborn, statewide literary figure) = OK.
 * - Missouri Compromise, Dred Scott case, Civil War border state history = OK.
 * - Current Governor: Mike Kehoe (58th Governor, sworn January 13, 2025).
 * - Missouri is the 24th state (admitted August 10, 1821).
 * - Missouri General Assembly: 34-member Senate + 163-member House.
 * - Term limits: 8 years per chamber (or 16 years total).
 * - Missouri borders 8 states — tied with Tennessee for most of any U.S. state.
 * - ALL officeholder questions MUST have expiresAt set.
 * - No addresses or phone numbers in answer options (quality rule).
 *
 * CURRENT OFFICEHOLDERS (verify before activating):
 * - Governor: Mike Kehoe (R, sworn January 13, 2025; ~term ends 2029-01-13)
 * - Lt. Governor: David Wasinger (R)
 * - Secretary of State: Denny Hoskins (R)
 * - Attorney General: Catherine Hanaway (R, appointed August 2025; first woman)
 * - State Treasurer: Vivek Malek
 * - Senate President Pro Tem: Cindy O'Laughlin (R, first woman in role, 2025)
