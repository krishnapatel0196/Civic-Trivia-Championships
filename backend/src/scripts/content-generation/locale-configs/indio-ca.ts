/**
 * Indio, CA locale configuration for civic trivia question generation.
 *
 * CRITICAL ACCURACY NOTES:
 * - Indio is in Riverside County; the county seat is the city of Riverside -- do NOT
 *   attribute Riverside County government to Indio city government
 * - Indio uses a council-manager form of government: 5-member City Council elected by
 *   district (Districts 1–5). Mayor is NOT directly elected by voters; the council
 *   rotates the mayor role annually among its members.
 * - Coachella Festival IS held at the Empire Polo Club IN INDIO -- it is correct to say
 *   "in Indio." The festival is named after the Coachella Valley, not the city of Coachella.
 * - The city of Coachella is a SEPARATE municipality east of Indio -- do not confuse the two
 * - Stagecoach Festival is also held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio
 * - Date farming heritage: Indio hosts the annual National Date Festival (Riverside County Fair)
 * - Fire service is provided by Riverside County Fire Department -- Indio does NOT have
 *   its own city fire department
 * - School districts: Coachella Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) serves the
 *   eastern portion of Indio; Desert Sands Unified School District (DSUSD) serves the
 *   western/northern portions -- do NOT attribute one district to all of Indio
 * - ALL officeholder questions MUST have expiresAt
 * - No addresses or phone numbers in answer options (quality rule)
 * - Verify state legislators (AD-36 / SD-28) district coverage on leginfo.legislature.ca.gov
 *   before activation
 *
 * CURRENT OFFICEHOLDERS (verify on indio.org before generation):
 * - Mayor: Waymond Fermon (rotating -- VERIFY current term end)
 * - Mayor Pro Tem: VERIFY on indio.org
 * - Council District 1: VERIFY on indio.org
 * - Council District 2: VERIFY on indio.org
 * - Council District 3: VERIFY on indio.org
 * - Council District 4: VERIFY on indio.org
 * - Council District 5: VERIFY on indio.org
 * - CA Assembly AD-36: Eduardo Garcia (term ends 2026-12-07)
 * - CA Senate SD-28: Jeff Stone (VERIFY -- may have changed; check leginfo)
 *
 * VOICE GUIDANCE:
 * - Do not confuse the Coachella music festival with the city of Coachella; the festival
 *   is in Indio even though it is named after the valley
 * - Do not say Indio has its own fire department -- fire service is Riverside County
 * - Questions about city council elections should clarify that mayor is not directly elected
 * - Elected-officeholder questions must include expiresAt; aim for 15-30% expiring
 * - Avoid questions about specific street addresses or building phone numbers
